## Overall context:

We will create a university enrollment database that will store information such as students’ first names, last names, dates of birth, contact information, ID number, date of enrollment, expected graduation year, and intended majors. We will also include data such as instructors’ and classes’ information. Moreover, as we progress through this class, we will be more specific with the data we want to store. Our purpose is to create a database that will organize information, hence, help universities keep and manipulate valuable data safely.

## Scope:

- **_Project Description_**: Our project will be used to store, retrieve, and alter the information held by universities.
- **_Project Resources_**: Our project resources are our team of highly experienced software programmers.
- **_Project Goals and Deliverables_**: To store student information securely and enable authorized users to access data promptly.
- **_Project Roadmap_**: project proposal by 10/07, sprint 1 by 11/04, sprint 2 by 11/18, sprint 3 by 12/02, and finally group video presentation by 12/07.
- **_Project Exclusions_**: Our project will only include relevant data for a higher institution; no other data will be included.

## Objectives:

Our end goal is to create a database all universities can use. One can have multiple purposes for this database - access student or faculty information, and find qualified students with high GPAs eligible for specific grants and scholarships. This database will enable users to find a student's advisor, background information, concentration, enrolled courses, completed courses, failed classes, grade point average, grade level, major, and professors.
