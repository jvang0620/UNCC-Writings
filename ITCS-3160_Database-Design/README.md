## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive university enrollment database capable of securely storing, retrieving, and managing essential information such as student and instructor details, enrollment data, and course information. The database will serve as a valuable tool for universities, enabling efficient organization and manipulation of vital data.

## Scope

- **Project Description**: The project will develop a database system tailored for universities to manage student and course data effectively.
- **Project Resources**: Our team comprises highly skilled software programmers dedicated to the project's success.
- **Project Goals and Deliverables**: Our goal is to create a secure database system that allows authorized users to access student information promptly and accurately.
- **Project Roadmap**:
  - Project proposal by 10/07
  - Sprint 1 by 11/04
  - Sprint 2 by 11/18
  - Sprint 3 by 12/02
  - Group video presentation by 12/07
- **Project Exclusions**: The database will only include relevant data pertinent to higher education institutions; extraneous data will be excluded.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a universally applicable database solution for universities. The database will facilitate tasks such as accessing student and faculty information, identifying eligible students for grants and scholarships based on academic performance, and providing detailed insights into student progress and course enrollment. Specific information to be stored includes student advisor details, course history, GPA, major, and more.
