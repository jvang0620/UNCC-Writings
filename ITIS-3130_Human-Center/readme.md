## Project Background

This project aims to develop a user-friendly application providing accurate and up-to-date information about Covid-19, tailored for the North Carolina community. Our focus lies in creating a design that emphasizes ease of use, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal to cater to diverse audience needs.

## User-Centric Design Approach

Throughout the design process, we prioritized a user-centric approach, incorporating feedback from participants across various demographics. Conducting user interviews, usability tests, and thematic analysis provided valuable insights into user preferences and pain points, guiding our design decisions.

## Key Insights and Improvements

**_Color Scheme and Design Aesthetic_**: Participants favored the minimalist design and color scheme of Design A, appreciating its aesthetic appeal.

**_Navigation and Back Button_**: Users expressed a preference for a back button to facilitate easier navigation, which we incorporated into the design to enhance usability.

**_Chatbot Feature_**: Feedback emphasized the importance of integrating a speech-to-text option, adding timestamps to conversations, and including more prompted messages for increased user engagement.

**_Zoom Feature and Covid-19 Locator_**: Participants suggested adding a pinch-zoom feature and prompts for specifying vaccine/booster brands to streamline user interactions and improve accessibility.

## Continuous Improvement

Our design process prioritizes continuous improvement, focusing on gathering user feedback, iteratively refining the application, and implementing features to meet evolving user needs. We are committed to delivering a high-quality, user-centric Covid-19 information application that serves as a valuable resource for the North Carolina community.

## Design Project Overview

**Course**: ITIS 3130 Human-Centered Design

**Project Focus**: Developing a user experience and interaction design for tasks involving human interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI).

### Project Stages:

1. **Introduction**: Describe the overall purpose of the app, highlighting its focus on providing a user experience involving AI interaction. Mention existing apps that inspired or are similar to your design.

2. **Needfinding**: Conduct focus group sessions to identify user characteristics and needs. Create personas based on the gathered information.

3. **Design Goals**: Define design goals focusing on usability principles and tasks achievable with the app. Illustrate goals with storyboards and user journeys for personas.

4. **Design Prototype**:

   - **Low Fidelity Design**: Present wireframes or schematics showcasing major interaction components. Connect prototypes to user journeys.
   - **Prototype Design**: Describe detailed design with high fidelity prototypes demonstrating visual design, interaction, and navigation techniques.

5. **Evaluation**: Restate design goals and identify evaluation goals. Conduct wizard of oz interviews and experimental usability studies. Modify design based on evaluation results.

6. **Summary**: Review design goals, concept, and how the evaluation reflects the quality of human-centered design.

## Conclusion

This design project challenges students to apply human-centered design principles to create an app that leverages Artificial Intelligence to enhance user experiences. By following a structured process from needfinding to evaluation, students gain valuable insights into user needs and preferences, leading to the development of effective and user-friendly designs. The project emphasizes the importance of iterative refinement based on user feedback, ensuring the final product meets the highest standards of human-centered design.
