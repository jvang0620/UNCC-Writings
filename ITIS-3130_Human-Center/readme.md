## Project Background:

Our project aimed to develop a user-friendly and informative application to provide accurate and up-to-date information about Covid-19. We focused on creating a design that prioritizes ease of use, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal to cater to a diverse audience.

## User-Centric Design Approach:

Throughout the design process, we adopted a user-centric approach, incorporating feedback from participants across various demographics. By conducting user interviews, usability tests, and thematic analysis, we gained valuable insights into user preferences and pain points, guiding our design decisions.

## Key Insights and Improvements:

From pages 1 to 59 of our project documentation, several key insights emerged:

**_Color Scheme and Design Aesthetic_**: Participants generally favored the color scheme and layout of Design A, appreciating its minimalist and aesthetic appeal.

**_Navigation and Back Button_**: Users expressed a preference for a back button to facilitate easier navigation between pages, which we incorporated into the design for improved usability.

**_Chatbot Feature_**: Feedback highlighted the importance of integrating a speech-to-text option, adding timestamps to conversations, and including more prompted messages for enhanced user engagement.

**_Zoom Feature and Covid-19 Locator_**: Participants suggested adding a pinch-zoom feature and prompts for specifying vaccine/booster brands to streamline user interactions and improve accessibility.

## Continuous Improvement:

Our design process emphasizes continuous improvement, with a focus on gathering user feedback, iteratively refining the application, and implementing features to meet evolving user needs. We are committed to delivering a high-quality, user-centric Covid-19 information application that serves as a valuable resource for our target audience.

## Design Project Overview

Course: ITIS 3130 Human-Centered Design

Project Focus: Developing a user experience and interaction design for tasks involving human interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Project Stages:

Introduction: Describe the overall purpose of the app, highlighting its focus on providing a user experience involving AI interaction. Mention existing apps that inspired or are similar to your design.

Needfinding: Conduct focus group sessions to identify user characteristics and needs. Create personas based on the gathered information.

Design Goals: Define design goals focusing on usability principles and tasks achievable with the app. Illustrate goals with storyboards and user journeys for personas.

Design Prototype:

Low Fidelity Design: Present wireframes or schematics showcasing major interaction components. Connect prototypes to user journeys.
Prototype Design: Describe detailed design with high fidelity prototypes demonstrating visual design, interaction, and navigation techniques.
Evaluation: Restate design goals and identify evaluation goals. Conduct wizard of oz interviews and experimental usability studies. Modify design based on evaluation results.

Summary: Review design goals, concept, and how the evaluation reflects the quality of human-centered design.

Conclusion:

This design project challenges students to apply human-centered design principles to create an app that leverages Artificial Intelligence to enhance user experiences. By following a structured process from needfinding to evaluation, students gain valuable insights into user needs and preferences, leading to the development of effective and user-friendly designs. The project emphasizes the importance of iterative refinement based on user feedback, ensuring the final product meets the highest standards of human-centered design.
