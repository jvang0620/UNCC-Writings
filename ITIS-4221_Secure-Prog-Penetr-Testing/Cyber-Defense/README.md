# Cyber Defenses: Evaluating Application Vulnerabilities with SQL and XSS

## Overview

This document presents a detailed vulnerability assessment and system assurance report focusing on SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Tunestore application. The purpose of this assessment is to highlight critical security flaws that could be exploited by attackers to manipulate or compromise the application and its data integrity.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this assessment is to exploit existing vulnerabilities within the Tunestore application to demonstrate the potential risks and impact. These findings aim to assist developers in understanding and mitigating these risks through appropriate security measures and coding practices.

## SQL Injection

We explore several methods by which SQL injection can be utilized to breach the application, from impersonating other users to manipulating database entries. These demonstrations highlight significant security oversights in user input handling and authentication processes.

## XSS Vulnerability

Our examination reveals how XSS can be used to execute malicious scripts on the client side, compromising user interactions and data privacy. Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities are covered, providing insights into how these can be mitigated.

## Conclusion

This report underscores the necessity for rigorous security protocols and regular vulnerability assessments to safeguard applications against emerging threats. Developers and security teams are encouraged to use this report as a guideline for enhancing security measures and ensuring robust application defenses.
