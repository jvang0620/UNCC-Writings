# Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Systems-Assurance-

## Overview

This report details a rigorous security analysis focusing on identifying and exploiting significant vulnerabilities within a software application. The assessment includes testing for various security weaknesses, including Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Broken Access Control, and DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By documenting these vulnerabilities and demonstrating practical exploits, the report aims to underline the critical need for robust security measures and provide insights into effective defensive strategies.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this assessment is to expose the vulnerabilities within the application to demonstrate the potential risks and the impact of exploitation. This effort helps developers and security professionals understand the urgency of addressing these issues, guiding them to implement more secure coding practices and safeguards in their applications.

## Key Findings

**_CSRF Vulnerabilities_**: Showcased through unauthorized actions like adding friends, gift-giving, and password changes, revealing the dangers of unsanitized external inputs.
**_Broken Access Control_**: Highlighted by unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data, demonstrating the risks associated with improper permission settings.
**_DOM-XSS Vulnerabilities_**: Exposed through scenarios where attackers can harvest user credentials, emphasizing the need for secure handling of user inputs.
**_Clickjacking Attacks_**: Illustrated by tricking users into performing unintended actions, pointing out the necessity for robust frame handling and user interaction security.

## Conclusion

This report underscores the vital importance of continuous security testing and updates. By proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, developers can significantly enhance the security and integrity of their applications, protecting against sophisticated cyber threats.
